                <p>In the final moments of <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, I had wished for nothing more than the long hinted at emotional interactions between Raskolnikov and Sonya to blossom fully. Surprisingly, the outcome was genuinely heartwarming in stark contrast to the rest of the novel. The undertone and psychological tension were constantly present up until that moment. Although the death of Rasknolnikov or Sonya would have been devastating, I had fully expected that to be the outcome.</p>
                <p>The fact that Dostoyevsky gave Raskolnikov a chance at redemption is almost inspiring for those who read this masterpiece. A man who gave away years of his life to prison life which resulted in separation from those who care for him dearly on a physical and mental level.</p>
                <p>All because he went after his notion of superiority being above formal and social norms. Before realizing his genuine love for Sonya, Raskolnikov believed that his punishment is only because he had failed by confessing in comparison to those who seized their opportunities regardless of the punishments. He states the only way he could only accept his crime is through the understanding that he had given up instead of those like Napolean who felt justified in their actions. Raskolnikov thought that he had not the conviction necessary to rid himself of his guilt hence leading to his downfall.</p>
                <p className="shift">&ldquo;Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Raskolnikov&rsquo;s theory of transcending crime is still ingrained as his core philosophy even after being convicted. His incapability of understanding other&rsquo;s reasoning is shown from the very moment that Porfiry attempted to argue it. Raskolnikov&rsquo;s narcissism disallows him from listening to others. This is the reason why he has such a hard time creating friendships at any location whether that be at university or prison camps. It can be inferred that his personality makes it seem as if he is looking down on others like that of a king talking to a peasant.</p>
                <p>Raskolnikov&rsquo;s understanding of social classes is entirely black and white. His categorization of people into either exceptional and non-exceptional people is a simplistic way of gauging hierarchy among people. It also gives the former the ability to rise above established norms and even sacrifice the latter for those exceptional as a stepping stone.</p>
                <p>Perhaps that is why he feels so connected with Sonya; he feels that they are the same type of person. A person that can transcend a sin because it is done as a deed to further a career no different from that of Napoleon. That in of itself is a major flaw in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s ideology. His inability to realize that when you strip the idea down to its core all that remains is a selfish act that benefits none other than yourself.</p>
                <p>Ironically, Sonya&rsquo;s sins are for the benefit of her family. Interestingly enough, nearly no character throughout the novel realizes this. Characters who do speak on the manner of Sonya&rsquo;s acts blame her for resorting to indecency to support her family.</p>
                <p>Whereas nearly no character throughout the novel realizes that Raskolnikov&rsquo;s acts alienate himself from his closed ones because he only has his own goals in mind. The major characters that support him all do so with no hesitation or objection even until the end. They felt the need or duty to aid Raskolnikov&rsquo;s in any shape or form. Even going as far as to allow him to separate himself from them to let him &ldquo;succeed&rdquo;.</p>
                <p>I want to believe that at the end of the novel Raskolnikov&rsquo;s truly realized what his crime and respective punishment were. That the endless affection and care from Sonya finally revitalized his human empathy.</p>
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                <p className="shift">On Raskolnikov&rsquo;s Theory</p>
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                <p>While his consciousness was eating him alive, Raskolnikov had realized it himself; Napoleon would have not questioned his morals nor succumb to psychological trauma.</p>
                <p className="shift">&lsquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rsquo; he declared, solemnly and resolutely. &lsquo;Away with<br/>mirages, away with imaginary terrors, away with phantoms!&#8230;<br/></p>
                <p>The categorization of humanity into such simplistic terms is a concept that can be done, yet the idea should never thereafter affect one&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>
                <p>Why so?</p>
                <p>In the manner that Raskolnikov had done it, the theory results from the most exceptionally influential leaders in history. The aftermath of their careers as one will.</p>
                <p>To link the crimes against humanity committed by those noteworthy spearheaders of history with one&rsquo;s own consciousness and lifestyle is dangerous in of itself, for this almost nearly forces one to commit wrongdoings as a way to proceed in any shape or form.</p>
                <p>Raskolnikov&rsquo;s inability to pinpoint his own flaws is evident in people in real life as well. Although the environment does foster specific disadvantages/advantages for any individual, in particular, redlining as an example, the truth is that there are many aspects overlooked in this theory. Raskolnikov was blinded by his theory to focus on smaller projects that could lead to personal growth or advancement. He forsook small jobs because they are insignificant to him. He wished to advance his career in one step.</p>
                <p>Razumikhin himself would disprove the innate disadvantages of his environment by working slowly yet enduringly to improve his financial situation through translations. A job that he is found to be a constant variable throughout the entire plot. His ability to stay constant disregarding everything happening is a constant reminder that one is only confined by his self imposed restrictions.</p>
