               <p>For starters, <i>Brave New World</i> seems so vastly dissimilar from the other dystopian novels I have read. Even so, it remains true to the foreboding style of the dystopian genre albeit in a much more subtle manner. The overarching singular &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; entity is nonexistent here. Instead, the entire population of the Earth has become so accustomed to the developments in conditioning to the point that it was unimaginable to society that there would be someone who would go against it. Sure enough, every character who originally who felt rebellious to the &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; would eventually succumb to what the Savage had called, brave new world.</p>

<p>The conclusion of <i>Brave New World</i> seemed to suggest that that society would be complacently happy with giving up past ideologies for the sake of a perfect, genetically altered, universe. Bernard and even the iron-willed Savage would indulge themselves in the pleasures of this world because of the allure and compelling nature radiated by the vast majority of civilization.</p>

<p>In Anthem, society genuinely advances backward, and the novel shows the reader how primitive those characters are living. The dramatic irony of the situation is interesting because the reader understands how much they have lost while the characters believe that they are much better off. The world of <i>Brave New World</i> does indeed advance significantly in genetic research as well as &ldquo;medicine&rdquo;. However, dystopian novels never truly de-advance in the sense of technology or research. Instead, they lose values that are the core basis of human existence and interaction.</p>

<p>The world we know is different from all these other novels not because they have &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; watching over you, which is a concerning topic on its own. No, the real distinction is that we have retained our cultures and values for hundreds of years. Many traditions are passed down for ages and even some create modern traditions to pass down. Imagine if down the road we decided through scientific research that children brought up by a third-party are much more likely to foster beneficial growth of children&rsquo;s education or development than the traditional way. The outrage. The preposterousness.</p>

<p>That is the world that dystopia truly paints for you. A world where values no longer align with what we had once believed in the past.</p>

<p>Well, what if those values were wrong? Perhaps the change could be beneficial after all?</p>

<p>This argument banks on the idea that change is simply an aspect of human progress and therefore unavoidable.</p>

<p>On one hand, some changes in thinking have been accepted due to universal acceptance.</p>

<p>Exhibit A: Racism.</p>

<p>It is universally understood that racism brews a terrible society. Or at least, mostly. This change took hundreds of years to culminate today. Numerous events and laws and protests (more recently, as of the writing, riots) have led to reforms that have a clear benefit on societal civility. There are no clear disadvantages that result from this reform. Furthermore, it took all of history from the past to present to finally result in this high point or turning point of global acceptance that racism is inherently immoral.</p>

<p>Exhibit B: Technological advancements that result in global cultural changes as well as a complete shift in societal functions.</p>

<p>For starters, this marks a much more drastic change that affects many more fronts than racism. It affects the basis of life. It affects how humans will function in a larger part. Racism at its core is how one treats another of different origins. Interaction between humans is merely one mode of communication albeit an important one. In<i> Brave New World</i>, the Alphas treat those below them with pretentiousness but appreciation for the fact that they exist to complete tasks that they could not stand.</p>

<p>The jump from normal society to a dystopian world is so short that it leaves little room for these changes to even be evaluated without bias. Sure, the idea of being at a paradise is entrancing. However, what happened to the research on psychedelics and other drugs that simulate out-of-this-world experiences? Were they too, deemed unfit for overconsumption?</p>

<p>The sudden advancement in technological fields is the true horror that dystopian writers mean to warn the future of when writing these novels.</p>

<p> Momentous change results in substantial change. <br />
Are we living in this future? A future where technology has already passed humanity? <br />
It is rather hard to not be jaded when one is constantly hearing the phrases, &ldquo;Big Brother is real&rdquo;, &ldquo;We are living in 1984&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Orwell predicted the future&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have seen numerous times on the Internet where others mention [insert dystopian book] as our present. Ironically enough, the book is almost always mentioned in the wrong circumstance or used in a manner that exaggerates a small incident.</p>

<p>Truthfully, the exaggeration is healthy. It keeps everyone on their toes. However, the reality is that those dystopias are lightyears away from our current society. The ability to even recite dystopian novels in response to censorship/totalitarianism is proof that our world is exponentially different.</p>

<p>The 21st century marked many advancements and reforms. Yet those advancements were not nearly enough to spark a dystopian society to form.</p>

<p>Civilization in <i>Brave New World</i> became addicted to the amount of pleasure they could have daily. For them, the lure of these privileges outweighs the satisfaction of having an independent mind that lives its individual life without conditioning.</p>

<p>Thus, it is fair to assume that to reach a world similar to <i>Brave New World</i>, humanity as a collective group must be willing to sacrifice their individuality for a fake identity that technology could offer them. Once the temptation of advances to a certain point, the question will arise; will the majority of people be allured?</p>
