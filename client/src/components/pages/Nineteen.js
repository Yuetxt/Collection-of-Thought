When I first decided that I was going to read Orwell&rsquo;s dystopian novel, I had already been made aware of the general idea of Nineteen Eighty-Four thanks to the innumerable times the novel has been mentioned in media due to current events. In particular, China&rsquo;s desire to monitor and censor many aspects of the internet in a way similar to how the Thought police punish those with ideas unapproved by the collective society.</p>


<p>Nineteen Eighty-Four never fails to be mentioned in popular culture because of its relevancy. Its lifespan seems almost immortal along with the legacy that it has in store for those who read it in the past/present/future. Those who read it in the past must have had felt a twinge of worry and precaution. Those who read it in the present feel obliged to compare themselves to the fictional society in the novel. Those who read it in the future will likely either scoff at or feel a sense of rue for it.<br/>
In a similar vein to Animal Farm, this novel follows suit by describing the ultimate descent into a deprecating and depressive state. A descent that is so hopeless that the readers are constantly begging the question of, &ldquo;Is this really going to be how it ends?&rdquo;.</p>


<p>
I had already read the likes of Anthem and Fahrenheit 451 before 
reading this novel. As it turns out, this novel happens to mention a thought 
I had when I read the two aforementioned novels; the characters that are 
enlightened or aware are paradoxically the threat to society while also 
being its savior.</p> 


<p>If a dystopia can truly fulfill the condition of maintaining 
its power indefinitely, then is it still a dystopia instead of a utopia? After 
reading Nineteen Eighty-Four, it felt almost incriminating to say what I previously 
thought. The issue is that when everyone truly feels like they are living in a utopia 
even under dubious circumstances then no man is wiser, literally. Onlookers such as the 
readers feel the obligation to boldly claim these novels portray a dystopic setting and 
therefore immoral. Why? Because we are the protagonist in a sense. Every reader of these 
types of novels is presumptively in the same mindset as the lead character. However, in a 
world where having that mindset is scarce, it is almost perfectly an alternative universe 
governed by another set of rules. In the present society, do we not punish those outliers 
that commit crimes? Unlawful activities go punished because we, as the majority, agreed that those activities 
are unlawful and should, therefore, be punished. Whether it be Fahrenheit 451 or Anthem or Nineteen Eighty-Four or Brave New World, it is 
exemplified over and over that the majority believes a concept that is contrary to everything that the readers are used to. However, outside of the 
books, everyone (mostly) understands the idea to be respectful of cultural differences when stepping foot on foreign land. Why is this? The fact that 
the majority of the people in the foreign land are completely complacent with their lifestyles disregarding the differences. In fact, they most 
likely are even less aware of it. That stays consistent even inside of the dystopian novels. While the ideas within the novel make the readers 
uncomfortable, the ideas that we possess frightens them just the same. As for the debate on the ethical aspect, I must say that comes down to a 
philosophical stance of how much are we willing to sacrifice for a utopia.</p>


<p>
I hope that when I look back on my words today in the future I will be more qualified to talk on how 
whether Nineteen Eighty-Four was a warning instead of a prediction.
