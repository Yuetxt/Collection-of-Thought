                <p>Once you read to a certain point, typically around the falling action, the conclusion is almost like it&rsquo;s already known. The entire bodies of paragraphs before it has all lead up to this ultimate end that becomes guessable.</p>

<p>In a way, that was how I felt towards <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. When Gatsby failed to spark the connection between him and Daisy any further, I had felt as if that was in of itself the end of the novel. It was like a final, desperate attempt at rekindling that ended up exactly that. A final attempt.</p>

<p>For a while, I was a little confused about why Daisy chose Tom over a man whom she knows she would rather be with deep inside.</p>

<p>Or at least, that is what the novel is hoping to illustrate throughout the beginning. <br />
The internal turmoil of Daisy and Tom&rsquo;s relationship. In particular, the affair that Tom was almost openly having displayed an insane amount of disrespect for his wife. The call from Myrtle early on when Nick was over at the dinner with Daisy and Tom along with Jordan.</p>

<p>Also highlighting the words that Daisy said when the topic of her daughter came up is telling in more ways than one:</p>

<p className="shift">&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll be a fool&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It perfectly encapsulates the ideology of Daisy and also lays out the exact reason why she chose Tom over Gatsby at the end of the novel.</p>

<p>She chose a luxurious and stable life over Gatsby&rsquo;s sporadic and shady one. Most likely, she also wishes her daughter to do the same one day; marry into a wealthy family that can support her for the rest of her life using her beauty while ignorant of all else.</p>

<p>No matter how one feels about it, women in the real world who are like Daisy are not remotely wrong for relying on their born assets to carry them through life. Some people feel that it is unfair that someone else can just breeze through life using looks alone. Sure, for the early years, yes they can indeed do that. There is some hollowness to that sort of life in comparison to one that is sustained by hardships and dedication. I would assert that life loses much of its meaning without a reachable, albeit far away, destination. If it is too close, then the satisfaction of reaching that goal diminishes greatly.</p>

<p>However, that is not the focus of my first chapter entry on this novel.</p>

<p>The focus is on the consequence of Daisy&rsquo;s decision.</p>

<p>Sadly, for Gatsby mostly, Daisy will likely remain married to Tom for the rest of their lives. An unhappy marriage in the most unfortunate way; the disloyalty and mindsets between these two people converge to create chains for both characters.</p>

<p>On one hand, Daisy loves Tom for his wealth (which is many times greater and stable than Gatsby&rsquo;s) and lifelong high-class status.</p>

<p>On the other, Daisy loves Gatsby because of his charm in a general manner along with the chemistry that they once had that was sparked when the two reconciled.</p>

<p>Is it not sad that Daisy chose riches over someone who is clearly deeply in love with her in a manner that shows complete loyalty? Daisy originally had likely wanted to wait for Gatsby to return from his war duties. But then she married Tom.</p>

<p>Of course, Gatsby&rsquo;s dedication is essentially bordering on obsession with the past. A past that Daisy was willing to sacrifice for immediate wealth and as we know, this decision was repeated in the novel.</p>

<p>It is clear that this decision haunted Gatsby much more than it affected Daisy.</p>

<p>Daisy likely never once thought about Gatsby after marrying Tom as she even states that she loved Tom in those five years when Gatbsy was away.</p>

<p>Gatsby&rsquo;s insecurities were revealed when he refused to accept Daisy saying that she loved Tom during those five years. He was not satisfied with simply having Daisy back. He wanted her love and loyalty. A virtue that is nonexistent in Daisy and Tom.</p>

<p>With or without George Wilson, Gatbsy would have likely committed suicide anyways because of his failure to win Daisy over in the present and the past. It was simply an impossible dream from the very beginning. If I was more well-read, I would probably tie that in with the American Dream. But truthfully, I don&rsquo;t know enough about that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll revisit this section in the future.</p>
