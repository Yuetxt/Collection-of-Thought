<p>Or is it? Well, the play is rated rather favorably on many sites, so it is clear that there is some subtle genius involved from Beckett. The lightbulb only shined for me when I started to actively search for little tidbits that seem to be pointlessly spoken words. Vladimir and Estragon repeat many phrases that almost always result in circular logic back to the words, &ldquo;We are waiting for Godot to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question of hanging themselves on the tree.</p>

<p>The miraculous &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; growth of the tree being exaggerated by Beckett through the characters. This on its own suggests that the characters may possibly see it themselves as something incredibly rare. Would the idea that this interaction is the exemplification from Beckett that life is precise in of itself? As mentioned, the idea of suicide was only merely jested about by Vladimir and Estragon.</p>

<p>What of Pozzo and Lucky? These two characters change drastically in the second act. They too, show how precious every single day is as well. It could be plausible if we view these two as the effects of a tragedy that could alter one&rsquo;s life completely. Interestingly enough, literature analysis websites assert the exact opposite of this idea; the morality of mankind is found in the words &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo;. That Vladimir and Estragon wish to get out of this eternal cycle of waiting that symbolizes life as a whole. Thus, they contemplate hanging. Perhaps I have not looked far enough, but it does seem that the consensus is that the meaninglessness of the play lends itself to the pointlessness of life while waiting for any significant meaning (Godot/God) to appear. And so there never will be any definite meaning because Godot will eternally never show up as shown by the play.</p>

<p>Although Vladimir and Estragon are constantly stuck in a loop of waiting for a man named Godot, Pozzo and Lucky are not bound by the existential need for &ldquo;Godot&rdquo; to show up. It could be inferred that if Vladimir and Estragon were to abandon waiting for Godot, then they could easily escape the meaningless life they are experiencing. They could easily follow along with Pozzo and Lucky to resolve conflicts on both sides.</p>

<p>Vladimir and Estragon would essentially break out of their cycle.</p>

<p>Pozzo and Lucky would be able to avoid succumbing to falling over endlessly.</p>

<p>After delving a little deeper into the Beckettverse, it seems that Beckett had a background in Christian faith. However, he would speak of its vices (as shown in this play) openly in his works.</p>

<p>The atheistic aspect in <i>Waiting for Godot</i> reveals itself when one considers that if the characters were to completely stop (as mentioned above) waiting for a &ldquo;God&rdquo; to give them meaning, then they will live lives no longer meaninglessly in hopes of a higher-order entity appearing.</p>

<p>By this definition, one can understand religion as a hidden chain that confines humans in a powerless manner in the face of an entity that holds insurmountable power over them without ever displaying itself.</p>

<p>Religion is a tricky matter to navigate, so I will only briefly comment on this section.</p>

<p>Disregarding Beckett&rsquo;s motives for writing Godot in a manner similar to God, the play itself suggests that life is an endless cycle of spiraling into repetition daily (morning routines or schedules) and meaningless actions that ultimately all end up at a single point eventually: death. Perhaps that is a tad bit darkening, but that is classical literature in a nutshell after all. <br />
An interesting play that would make for a fantastic read later on in life. It would be fairly interesting to return back to this play as one aged into the hardships of adulthood and, finally, inevitable elderhood.<br />
