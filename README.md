# collection of thoughts

This project is based on my love of literature. 
Every so often I write up a piece on a book that I had read recently. 
The contents of each of these "essays" vary depending on what I felt at the time of reading.

I would like to thank Cory Lynch from web.lab at MIT for giving me permission to use a skeleton code as the barebones of my little project.
