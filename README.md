# collection of thoughts

This project is based on my love of literature. 
#
Every so often I write up a piece on a book that I had read recently. 
#
The contents of each of these "essays" vary depending on what I felt at the time of reading.

I would like to thank Cory Lynch from web.lab at MIT for giving me permission to use a code skeleton from web.lab as the starting point of my website's code.
Furthermore, I would like to thank web.lab even more for putting their lectures online as that taught me much of what I needed to start my project.
